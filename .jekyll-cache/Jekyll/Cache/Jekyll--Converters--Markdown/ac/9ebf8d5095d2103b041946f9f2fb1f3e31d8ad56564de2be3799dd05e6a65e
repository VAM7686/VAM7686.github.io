<p><strong>TLDR: Kevin is not good. Mane is a much better option. Liverpool’s defense looks very good. Son and Kane are great, Son more so. Lamptey is a scam. Ruben Dias is fantastic. Wolves are a mess. My chip plan: Wildcard for GW16, Free Hit for GW18, and Bench Boost for GW19.</strong></p>

<h3 id="liverpool">Liverpool</h3>
<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson were great last week in a 7-0 smackdown against Crystal Palace. Getting in one or the other is really a coin flip. Robertson is getting farther forward and Trent is putting in these amazing crosses in the final third. Last year with VVD in the box VVD got five goals off Trent’s deliveries which is kinda wild. Both are really great and fun. Mane has been problematic with his streaky form. However, with Liverpool’s upcoming fixtures in the form of West Brom, Newcastle, and Southampton as well as their ability to score goals Mane looks like a good pick. Maybe a good enough pick to justify going from De Bruyne to Mane. Manchester City does not seem like they want to go for goals and they typically end their games with a 1-0, 2-0, or 2-1. Maybe those socres have the potential for KDB to get in an assist and perhaps some bonus points but not much else besides that. So yeah, Mane looks like a good differential pick.</p>

<h3 id="kevin-de-bruyne">Kevin De Bruyne</h3>
<p>Manchester City is going against Newcastle and I have no clue what to expect. City might get six goals or they might get zero. It really just depends on how City players. But I don’t see KDB getting too many points and right now Kev is just a bad pick. KDB does not have any open play goals, just two goals from penalties. At 12.0 million it is not worth it to hold Kev.</p>

<h3 id="spurs">Spurs</h3>
<p>Spurs do not seem like a good team for FPL. Spurs sit on their leads and they do not push. But Son is a goal scoring machine. It doesn’t matter who the manager is Son will manage to score. Kane might be a bit more consistent, but against open teams like Leeds Son is the obvious pick. Spurs just really confuse me. They don’t create too many chances but their players, Son and Kane, are so good that it doesn’t matter. The chances they have are enough for them to rack up points. Spurs don’t really get in the box enough to get penalties so I’m not sure if that really matters.</p>

<h3 id="lamptey-is-a-scam">Lamptey is a scam.</h3>
<p>What a bait. Like Jesus Navas when he was on Manchester City. Terrible pick. Brighton is a scam. Burnley is so much better. Charlie Taylor is a great player. So cheap and so good. Taylor is able to put in balls from the edge of the final third for Wood and Barnes and gets those assists. You wouldn’t expect these balls to do anything coming from the middle of nowhere but it actually works. Lowton isn’t as good but at 4.4 million he’s not too bad.</p>

<h3 id="defenders">Defenders</h3>
<p>Aston Villa’s fixtures coming up are not great and I don’t expect them to do so well. Same thing with Southampton. Southampton are almost like Leeds in that I never really expect them to hold a cleansheet. With that said, Vestergaard on Southampton looks like he should be scoring every game. It’s insane. Every corner Southampton take, Vestergaard looks he can score. Also, Vestergaard plays these really nice balls over the top so overall just an interesting gamble.</p>

<p>West Brom also looks interesting. Sam Allardyce is shaping them up and they might have some cleansheet potential.</p>

<p>Ruben Dias is a great pick. Dias is under five percent owned, absolutely nailed, and is on one of the best defensive teams in the Premier League. Great differential and great pick.</p>

<h3 id="popular-picks-that-are-awful-picks">Popular picks that are awful picks</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Kevin De Bruyne for aforementioned reasons</li>
  <li>Callum Wilson</li>
  <li>James Ward Prowse - worldie freekick merchant on Southampton</li>
  <li>Dallas - left back who plays on Leeds, probably the most open defense in the league. Shoots every game and tries to score a worldie so there’s that.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rambling">Rambling</h3>
<p>With all the flags coming up I think it is really worth it to take hits to bring in good players. Also this week besides Spurs vs Leeds I do not think that there will be that many high scoring games.</p>

<p>Wolves are a shambolic mess.</p>

<h3 id="captain-options-this-week">Captain Options This Week:</h3>
<p>Bruno Fernandes seems like a great choice. This past week has put some doubts in my head, but maybe Bruno will come back better than before and destroy Leeds. 
Mo Salah is also a great pick. He’s reliable, on penalties, and just an incredible player.
Kevin De Bruyne is also an option with a great fixture. So many great fixtures this week it’s hard to choose</p>

<h3 id="my-gameweek-15-team">My Gameweek 15 Team:</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/gw15Team.png" alt="My Gameweek 15 Team" /></p>

<p>My Gameweek 15 Team. I shipped out KDB and brought in Mane because Mane is a wonderful human being and I want one last wild transfer before my wildcard. Who can stop me? Me? Well that ship has sailed. Anyways. Hoping that KDB won’t make me regret my decision and I’m going with my Salah captaincy choice since it’s the most obvious. Hopefully things go smoothly this week.</p>

<p>Also looking to get to get Lamptey the scam artist out asap. Bruh. He looks so good when he plays but he gets nothing. Nothing. Just red cards and pain. Anyways. Wildcard for GW16, free hit for GW18, and bench boost for GW19 is the plan.</p>
