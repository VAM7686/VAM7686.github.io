<h3 id="leeds">Leeds:</h3>
<p>Leeds got absolutely wrecked by Chelsea. Really uncompetitive, probably their worst game this season. Should have probably been 7-1. Completely obliterated. So far, Leeds have been iffy and have been relying a lot on Bamford and it’s showing. Their midfields are also not good enough. Rafinha has got a ton of skills but it’s not enough. Jack Harrison is also not great. Alioski not even close to Premier League standard. Almost like the New York Giants, no talent but great coaching. The Leeds game against Chelsea was not great possibly just because Chelsea had better players all around. Chelsea was just domininating Leeds. So much pace and skill to constantly break through Leeds’ back line. Leeds constantly found themselves outclassed. In fact, Kante was just beating Leeds at their own game with his insane work rate and pace advantage. This fixture pileup will be especially nasty for Leeds since they are a very high energy team. Leeds won’t have their usual week of rest and will be forced to play every couple days on a much tighter schedule without much result. The result won’t be too pretty. Will Leeds just fall off the second half of the season since Bielsa will just run his players into the ground? While this may be a concern for Leeds supporters this probably won’t be an issue for FPL managers who own Bamford. Bamford will keep running around and doing his thing shooting and scoring. Same thing with Leeds FPL wise. Leeds will constantly underperform their xG since they constantly keep shooting but don’t have good enough players to convert their chances into goals. Leeds’ game against Chelsea might indicate that worse is yet to come or it might indicate that they don’t do great against good teams at the top of the table. Leeds still have some easy games against teams like West Ham so they could just pop off and do well against those teams.</p>

<h3 id="everton">Everton</h3>
<p>Everton’s last game wasn’t that bad. Even James probably should have a goal and an assist. But they were playing Burnley and Burnley is not exactly top class so that might be why Everton wasn’t looking too bad. Everton does have some difficult games coming up in the form of Chelsea, Leicester, Arsenal, and Manchester City in four of their next five games. Everton has just five good players, four now with Digne out. All the other players on the squad are just team players who enable the top players to perform. For Everton to perform it seems like everything needs to be going right for them. With the pandemic, things are just getting harder for Everton. Just overall very frustrating.</p>

<h3 id="james-rodriguez">James Rodriguez</h3>
<p>Is it time to drop James? James is a fantastic player and I love to see him play and love him in general. However, in terms of FPL, James has got to go. It’s clear that James does not have the legs to run. With the fixture pile up this is going to be a major problem. At the moment, James is a deep line playmaker, almost like Thiago Alcântara at Liverpool. James is not really a forward, never really in the box, can’t really catch up to Richarlison and DCL on the counter attack, and has been blanking for an incredibly long time. James’ last return was an assist in GW5 against Liverpool. Right now there’s so many good premium options to replace James like Jack Grealish or Wilfred Zaha.</p>

<h3 id="dominic-calvert-lewin">Dominic Calvert-Lewin</h3>
<p>DCL does not create many chances. If DCL is able to poke in a goal in he scores or he doesn’t not. That being said, DCL’s movement is actually so good. I don’t think that there are any strikers who get chances where DCL is able get chances. Every single time when Everton is building up or counterattacking DCL is always able to find space. It’s just nuts. With my love for DCL now known, getting rid of DCL is a very valid argument. With Digne out for two months, Everton’s width has been a bit hampered. Couple this with Richarlison being selfish not making the right decisions and the harder fixtures coming up, selling DCL is pretty logical. Maybe transferring out DCL for these five bad gameweeks and then transferring back in might be wise.</p>

<h3 id="mid-priced-midfielders">Mid Priced Midfielders</h3>
<p>Ranking Jack and Wilf:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Jack Grealish is a great pick.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wilfred Zaha is also a great pick. The combination of Batshuayi coming back, Ayew being fit, and Zaha starting at the top makes it a no brainer to get Zaha in. Zaha is so good. Starting at striker and shooting more often Zaha is going to get the most goals he’ll ever have in a Premier League season. Just a great pick.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Don’t get James Ward-Prowse. Just don’t.</p>

<p>Pulisic is not good. Pulisic is good when he plays but he is a trap. Don’t go near this guy. Pulisic gets injury much easier.</p>

<p>Diogo Jota is not good.</p>

<h3 id="spurs">Spurs</h3>
<p>Son and Kane have been an unstoppable duo. This duo has been leading the league in combined goals and assists. So, is it time to get them out? Obviously no. Starting with Son; he is in such good form. Son’s goals have usually been worth around 5-6 points with his insane bonus points. Kane is number one in basically every statistic and that’s a player you want into your team.</p>

<p>I don’t see myself captaining Kane and Bamford does seem to keep up with him so I transferred Kane out and put in Bamford. I don’t feel bad about that. I do feel bad about not having Son. Partially because Son is 1.5 million cheaper and with that 1.5 you can have Salah, Bruno, KDB along with him.</p>

<p>Also I have no clue which fixtures are good for Spurs. Leeds and Southampton are good fixtures since Spurs are constantly able to counter and score but otherwise the goals are unpredicatable. This makes it hard for picking a captaincy.</p>

<h3 id="rambling">Rambling</h3>
<p>Timo Werner has hatrick potential. I like that. But formation keeps changing and Werner is playing reverse out of position. So far, Werner has had just one double digit return which is not acceptable. When you have DCL and Bamford who are two and three million less I don’t think Werner does not bring much value. Maybe I’m wrong.</p>

<p>Lamptey was not very good and it’s clear that Brighton cannot keep clean sheets. It’s hilarious that when I see a Lamptey highlight he’s the furthest guy</p>

<h3 id="captain-options-this-week">Captain Options This Week:</h3>
<p>Salah captain is pretty obvious this week. Liverpool at Everton is a great fixture and Salah sould return.</p>

<p>Maybe a Bamford captain with the West Ham fixture this week? This man just keeps returning.</p>

<h3 id="fpl-fallacies">FPL Fallacies</h3>
<p>People think that if they have many 40% owned players they won’t be able to rise since they dont have any differentials. The thing is that not many people have 3, 4, or even 5 of these 40% owned players in a single team. For instance, according to LiveFPL.com, in the top 10k of managers the combined ownership of Salah, De Bruyne, and Son is just 1.6%. This goes to show that owning combinations of highly owned players is in fact a differential in itself. What matters more is just getting your captaincy right. That will guarantee green arrows every week. If you have good players keep them. It’s clear that there are players in this game that have a small amount of risk and players that have a huge amount of risk. Just depends on how you want to play the game. Bottom line, nail your captain.</p>
