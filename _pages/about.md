Hi! I’m Vivek. Currently, I’m pursuing my BS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, specializing in computer architecture and computational intelligence (formally: threads in Systems & Architecture and Intelligence).

I'm the software lead on the Robojackets [RoboNav](https://github.com/RoboJackets/igvc-software) team. On RoboNav, we develop an autonomous robot to navigate an obstacle course and compete in the [IGVC](http://www.igvc.org/) competition.

I'll be updating this website with blog posts about things I'm interested in so stay tuned!
