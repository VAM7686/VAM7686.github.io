Hi! I’m Vivek. Currently, I’m pursuing my BS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, specializing in computer architecture and computational intelligence (formally: threads in Systems & Architecture and Intelligence).

I'm also a software member on the Robojackets Robonav team where I work on writing code for our autonomous robot. I'll be updating this website with blog posts about things I'm interested in so stay tuned!
