Liverpool’s defense might be a pick but there are so many better options in other teams like Chelsea. Bowen and Benrahma are fantastic. Different West Brom mentality now that Allardyce is manager? Anthony Martial looks excellent.</strong></p><h3 id="manchester-city-and-kevin">Manchester City and Kevin</h3><p>Manchester City is playing two defensive midfielders, and it does not seem like City are going to go back to their high scoring ways. Unless Aguero can return to his prime and go back to scoring ways, I don’t see Kevin De Bruyne getting assists. Kevin provides some incredible chances, but no one is there to finish them. What seems even worse for FPL is that Pep Guardiola seems to want City to play with such a defensive mindset. Right now, City is playing to win those 1-0, 2-0, and 2-1 games. Maybe Kevin is not a good pick? De Bruyne needs people to score so he can get some assists and points. Now that everybody on City is out of form, it’s hard for Kevin to get those points. Kevin also seems like he can’t get his shots off. Super slow stuff. To be fair, Kevin should have had a couple of goals. Still, it’s almost indefensible why anyone would have Kevin over Son. Son is playing striker and getting shots off while Kevin is feeding chances to Gabriel Jesus. Being the second most expensive player in the game, Kevin De Bruyne is not looking too good as an asset. The next two fixtures look great for Kevin; At Southampton and Home Newcastle are amazing attacking fixtures for City, and that could turn out well for Kevin.</p><h3 id="liverpool">Liverpool</h3><p>Liverpool is clearly the best team in the league. Last year when the fixture pileup came, Liverpool pulled ahead and destroyed. This year looks like the same thing might happen. So is this the time to bring in Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson? Maybe not. Hovering around seven million the price does not seem to justify the purchase given that City and other teams are pulling clean sheets.</p><h3 id="wolves">Wolves</h3><p>Neto is really good, but Wolves are a mess. Nuno is trying to figure things out with Jimenez gone, and I don’t expect things to get better until Jimenez comes back. Neto’s position is also a mess. Neto plays on the left, on the right, midfield, down the middle. I have no clue what’s going on there.</p><h3 id="west-ham">West Ham</h3><p>Benrahma is starting now. I think Benrahma has more goals in him than Bowen. When Benrahma plays, he’s selfish and had something like six shots against Leeds. Bowen and Benrahma are both so good.</p><h3 id="west-brom">West Brom</h3><p>Sam Allardyce has just signed on as manager for West Brom. What does this mean? Well, perhaps there might be some higher scoring games with West Brom. Sam Allardyce is not the type of manager who will park the bus against any top teams. No sir. Mr. Allardyce is an ex England manager. Also, this may make Johnstone a good pick given that he is going to have so many saves and so many bonus points. Even if Johnstone does not get a clean sheet, his bonus and saves would probably make up for it.</p><h3 id="anthony-martial">Anthony Martial</h3><p>Martial is a great player. My guy Tony could probably have a 20 goal season. Even 11 games in. In his game against Sheffield, I saw some glimpses of how good Tony really is. Tony just needs that french connection with Paul Pogba to send him no look through balls and just be great. A real high risk high reward pick here.</p><h3 id="saka">Saka</h3><p>Saka is so good. Even though Arsenal are terrible, Saka creates so many chances and is one of Arsenal’s best players. Maybe at 5.2 million, and when Soucek is an option, Saka might not be the best pick.</p><h3 id="captain-options-this-week">Captain Options This Week:</h3><p>Bruno Fernandes seems like a great choice. This past week has put some doubts in my head, but maybe Bruno will come back better than before and destroy Leeds. Mo Salah is also a great pick. He’s reliable, on penalties, and just an incredible player. Kevin De Bruyne is also an option with a great fixture. So many great fixtures this week it’s hard to choose</p></div></div></div></div></section><section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-12"><h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Comments 03</h4><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script> (function () { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//vam7686-github-io.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> </noscript></div></div></div></section><section class="section"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-12 text-center"><h2 class="section-title">Similar Stories</h2></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-6 mb-4"><article class="card shadow"> <img class="rounded card-img-top" src="/assets/images/blog/gw14.jpg" alt="Fantasy Premier League Gameweek 14 Preview"><div class="card-body"><h4 class="card-title"> <a class="text-dark" href="/2020/12/18/FPL-Gameweek14/">Fantasy Premier League Gameweek 14 Preview</a></h4><p class="card-text">Fantasy Premier League Preview for Gameweek 14.</p><a href="/2020/12/18/FPL-Gameweek14/" class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">Read More</a></div></article></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-6 mb-4"><article class="card shadow"> <img class="rounded card-img-top" src="/assets/images/blog/gw13.jpg" alt="Fantasy Premier League Gameweek 13 Preview"><div class="card-body"><h4 class="card-title"> <a class="text-dark" href="/2020/12/14/FPL-Gameweek13/">Fantasy Premier League Gameweek 13 Preview</a></h4><p class="card-text">Fantasy Premier League Preview for Gameweek 13.</p><a href="/2020/12/14/FPL-Gameweek13/" class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">Read More</a></div></article></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-6 mb-4"><article class="card shadow"> <img class="rounded card-img-top" src="/assets/images/blog/gw12.jpg" alt="Fantasy Premier League Gameweek 12 Preview"><div class="card-body"><h4 class="card-title"> <a class="text-dark" href="/2020/12/09/FPL-Gameweek12/">Fantasy Premier League Gameweek 12 Preview</a></h4><p class="card-text">Fantasy Premier League Preview for Gameweek 12.</p><a href="/2020/12/09/FPL-Gameweek12/" class="btn btn-xs btn-primary">Read More</a></div></article></div></div></div></section><section class="section section-on-footer" data-background="/assets/images/backgrounds/bg-dots.png"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-12 text-center"><h2 class="section-title">Contact Info</h2></div><div class="col-lg-8 mx-auto"><div class="bg-white rounded text-center p-5 shadow-down"><h4 class="mb-80">Contact Form</h4><form action="https://formspree.io/f/mzbkgaln" method="POST" class="row"><div class="col-md-6"> <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Full Name" class="form-control px-0 mb-4"></div><div class="col-md-6"> <input type="email" id="email" name="_replyto" placeholder="Email Address" class="form-control px-0 mb-4"></div><div class="col-12"> <textarea name="message" id="message" class="form-control px-0 mb-4" placeholder="Type Message Here"></textarea></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-10 mx-auto"> <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary w-100">send</button></div></form></div></div></div></div></section><footer class="bg-dark footer-section"><div class="section"><div class="container"><div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center"><div class="col-md-4"><h5 class="text-light">Email</h5><p class="text-white paragraph-lg font-secondary">vmhatre3@gatech.edu</p></div><div class="col-md-4"><h5 class="text-light">Location</h5><p class="text-white paragraph-lg font-secondary">Atlanta, Georgia, USA</p></div></div></div></div><div class="border-top text-center border-dark py-5"><p class="mb-0 text-light"><p>Copyright © 2020 Vivek Mhatre</p></p></div></footer><script src="/assets/plugins/jQuery/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/plugins/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/plugins/shuffle/shuffle.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/plugins/slick/slick.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/plugins/particles.js"></script> <script src="/assets/plugins/particles_master.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/script.js"></script></body></html>
