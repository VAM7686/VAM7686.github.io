# **A Brief Slap Analysis**

**TLDR: NBA ass slaps are no jokes.**

Watched [this video](https://gfycat.com/insecureenchantedislandcanary) of DeMarcus Cousins and Joel Embiid and decided to break down whats going on here.


It's clear to anyone with two eyes that DeMarcus Cousins is on a completely different planet in terms of the way that he slaps ass. Take a look around the 2.22s mark in the gif.

As you can see, the contour that Cousins has to his elbow and the torque he's getting from using more of his bicep and shoulder to smack Joel's ass here is going to allow him to have more longevity over the course of a season to grab boards and smack more asses. This is why Cousins regularly towers over others in this area.

Meanwhile, you have Joel Embiid. I understand Cousins has been in the league longer, but observe Embiid's form at 2.99s.

As I've highlighted above, you can see where ALL of Joel's energy is generated strictly from his wrist motion and whipping his elbow. This seems quite inefficient and frankly unprofessional. But this isn't the G League, Joel. This is the NBA. And if you want to last in this league, you HAVE to improve your form and step up your game in terms of slapping your comrades asses.
